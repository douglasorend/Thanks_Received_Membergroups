# THANKS RECEIVED MEMBERGROUPS v1.1

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](https://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4180)

-------

## MOD REQUIREMENTS
This mod requires the database tables that the [Say Thanks](https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=527032.msg3737095#msg3737095) mod creates.  If that mod is not installed, this mod will result to install!

Uninstalling the [Say Thanks](https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=527032.msg3737095#msg3737095) mod and removing the tables it creates will create and/or generally cause problems until this mod is removed.

No support will be rendered if these mod requirements are not met!  **YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!**

## Introduction
This mod changes the post-based membergroups to "thanks count"-based membergroups, where the number of thanks received from other members determines which membergroup you belong to.

## Admin Settings
In **Admin** => **Members** => **Membergroups** under any post-based membergroup, the **Required Posts** entry changes to **Number of Thanks Received**.  Current values are not modified as a result of installing this mod.
