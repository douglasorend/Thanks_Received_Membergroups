[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod changes the post-based membergroups to "thanks count"-based membergroups, where the number of thanks received from other members determines which membergroup you belong to.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
In [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Members[/b] => [b]Membergroups[/b] under any post-based membergroup, the [b]Required Posts[/b] entry changes to [b]Number of Thanks Received[/b].  Current values are not modified as a result of installing this mod.
